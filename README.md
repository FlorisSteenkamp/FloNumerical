# FloNumerical
An infinite precision floating point library

# Note
This library is now split into two, i.e. [double-doulbe](https://github.com/FlorisSteenkamp/double-double) for blazingly fast 
double-double precision arithmetic and [big-float-ts](https://github.com/FlorisSteenkamp/big-float-ts) for infinite precision arithmetic (up to overflow / underflow).

Please use those libraries instead.
